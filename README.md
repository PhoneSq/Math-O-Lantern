Math O’ Lantern 🎃

Math O’ Lantern is a spooky, Halloween-themed 2D game built with C++ and SDL2. Solve math challenges while dodging monsters shooting fireballs.

⚠️ Important Notes

This game uses SDL2 and SDL2_image, which rely heavily on the folder structure.

Do not move the .exe file out of the project folder. Even small changes in the folder or file paths can break the game.

Make sure all assets (images, icons, etc.) stay in the same directories as the project files.

On Windows, the easiest way to run the game is directly from the folder you cloned/downloaded.

🕹 How to Play

Launch MathHorrorGame.exe in the project folder.

Use the keyboard to move and interact (WASD).

Solve math puzzles when prompted to survive each level.

Avoid monsters — touching them sends you back or deducts points.

💻 Development Notes

Built with C++ and SDL2 (Simple DirectMedia Layer 2).

Uses .cpp, .h, and .rc files for gameplay and resources.

All assets (icons, images) are included in the repository.

If you’re compiling yourself, ensure SDL2 and SDL2_image are correctly linked and the working directory is set to the project root.
